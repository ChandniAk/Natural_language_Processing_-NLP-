# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews using various machine learning, deep learning models and LLM. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding public opinion and can be applied to various domains.

## Features
- Analyze movie reviews to determine their sentiment.
- Compare the performance of different models:
  - NLTK SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - BERT Transformer

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from online kaggle data. It includes 5 classes such as 0 - negative 1 - somewhat negative 2 - neutral 3 - somewhat positive 4 - positive

## Models Used
### NLTK SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
A rule-based model for general sentiment analysis.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A classical machine learning model for multiple class classification tasks.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction problems.

### BERT Transformer
A state-of-the-art transformer model for various NLP tasks, fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.

## Installation
