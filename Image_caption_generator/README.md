## Introduction

This project aims to generate captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating sequences of words. The application uses models like VGG16 for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence generation.

## Features

- Extract features from images using pre-trained CNN models.
- Generate captions using LSTM models.
- Evaluate model performance using BLEU scores.

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChandniAk/Natural_language_Processing_-NLP-/Image_caption_generator.git
    cd Image_caption_generator
    ```




## Usage

To use the image caption generator:

1. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Ensure you have a dataset of images and their corresponding captions.
   - Modify the data preprocessing script if necessary.

2. **Train the Model:**
   - Run the training script to train the model on your dataset.

3. **Model Training:**
# Data Preprocessing:

Extract features from images using a pre-trained CNN model.
Tokenize captions and create sequences of word indices.
# Model Training:

Train the model using the preprocessed data.
Save the trained model for generating captions.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance.
# Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using BLEU scores
